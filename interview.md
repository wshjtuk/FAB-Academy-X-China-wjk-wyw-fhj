## Interview

 - Interview 1

> Interviewer: Hello, I'm a student from ShanghaiTech University and doing a survey to help us accomplish the project. Would you please do me a favour?

Interviewee: Of course! Go ahead!

> Interviewer: First of all, are you a student or an office worker?

Interviewee: Still a student.

> Interviewer: Oh nice. So when you are in dormitory, studying or taking a rest, is there any situation that a classmate breaks in the door and disturbs you?

Interviewee: Emmm, when I am sleeping on bed, I usually lock the door, but sometimes a knock on the door may wake me up. And when studying, I hate being disturbed, but someone do break in all the time. Sometimes it makes me crazy.

> Interviewer: Oh that's terrible. Have you ever thought about locking the door when you study?

Interviewee: Yes, but it seems useless. A knock on the door forces me to take the time to open the door, it is also a waste of time.

> Interviewer: It sounds reasonable. If there is a kind of device can solve such a problem, how would you like to design it?

Interviewee: I don't know much on design or machine, but if the device can help me to lock or unlock the door intelligently without disturbing me, I will try this product.

> Interviewer: Oh I see! Thanks for you time.

- Interview 2

> Interviewer: Hello, I will simply ask you a few questions about the life during the epidemic and you just tell me your feelings, OK?

Interviewee: OK  
  
> Interviewer: My question is: In some public areas, such as the lift, for the reason that the virus can survive for a while at some surface. So you can’t touch the button directly. There are some advices, for example, use other tools such as a key to touch the button, put a bottle of alcohol in the lift and so on. What’s your opinion about this?

Interviewee: Oh, this is really a problem. Emmm, I remember one time, I have a lot of things in my hand, so that it’s hard for me to touch the button. Meanwhile, I have to get my key to help me touch it. So I have to put down those things. It really annoys me.  
  
> Interviewer: Haha, I have the same feelings, so do you have some advices?

  
Interviewee: I think we can use other parts of our body. For example, you can use your elbow to touch the button. And have you been to an operation room in the hospital?  
  
> Interviewer: No.

Interviewee: The doctors use their foot to open the door, so I am wondering if there is a foot controlled lift.  
  
> Interviewer: Great idea! In that case, even if we have things on my hand, we can control the lift.

Interviewee: Haha, yes.
