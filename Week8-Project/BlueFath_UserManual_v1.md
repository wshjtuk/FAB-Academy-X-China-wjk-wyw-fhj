# BlueFath User Manual



### Introduction

It is important to protect yourself under masks when necessary, for both health and privacy. During parties, it can be difficult to recognize others. The BlueFath helps you to identify friends even when they are wearing masks. This manual makes it easy for you to start using our product.

### Privacy

The identifier of your device can be revoked at any time. The image of your group is generated with random factors. Multiple devices in a group identify one another with Bluetooth Service UUID, which is generated randomly. You have the right to control your privacy data. The app and all BlueFath services will never share your personal information. Your accout info and friend list are stored with encryption.
